/**
 * Your custom bootstrap.
 *
 * The parent boostrapbase is responsible for including Bootstrap and all the related Moodle
 * stuff. It uses a set of variables to declare the default colours, sizing, etc...
 *
 * The problem, as we are here in a child theme, is that we cannot override any of the
 * variables, and thus we have to manually redeclare all of the rules that bootstrapbase
 * has set and manually re-set everything.
 *
 * Well, no, there is a solution! What we are going to do here is bypassing all the CSS
 * that boostrapbase is defining by redefining it ourselves. What is the purpose of
 * bootstrapbase then? Well, thankfully all the job has been done for us, and we are still
 * going to use that, the only difference is that we are not going to use the compiled
 * CSS files of bootstrapbase.
 *
 * How to use this file?
 * ---------------------
 *
 * 1/ You should learn a little bit how to be able to compile a LESS file, and for
 * that I recommend you to visit: http://docs.moodle.org/dev/LESS. Once you get familiar
 * with that, please remember that the CSS file that you will be generating has to be placed
 * in the style/ folder, along with the other CSS files. If you are using the command line
 * and you are in the less/ folder, the following command would do the job:
 *
 *   recess --compile mybootstrap.less > ../style/mybootstrap.css
 *
 * 2/ Make sure that you are including this file in your theme. To do so, you have
 * to add it to the list of sheets in your config.php. I highly recommend that you add this
 * one as the first of all the sheets. You should end up with something like this:
 *
 *   $THEME->sheets = array('mybootstrap', 'custom');
 *
 * 3/ You should tell your theme not to include the CSS file from bootstrapbase.
 * This is not a mandatory step, but it is highly recommended as it is pointless to load
 * the file from bootstrapbase as we will be overwriting 100% of its rules. This can be done
 * by using `parents_exclude_sheets`, you can simply copy the following in your config.php.
 *
 *   $THEME->parents_exclude_sheets = array(
 *     'bootstrapbase' => array('moodle')
 *   );
 *
 * Ok, now that you have prepared all the stuff, you can start adding variables to this file.
 * The complete reference of variables that can be used can be found in
 * theme/bootstrapbase/less/bootstrap/variables.less.
