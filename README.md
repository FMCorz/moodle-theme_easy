Easy Moodle Theme
=================

A very basic theme, made easy for new themers.

Introduction
------------

In Moodle 2.5 was introduced the theme 'Clean', which purpose was (but not only) to make it easier to start off a new theme. While it is definitely a lot easier than before, there are still a few concepts that might confuse some of the new themers out there. This theme trimmed out all the unnecessary things to leave a cleaner 'Clean'.

- No more settings, and so, no more use of the settings
- No more specific confusing functions
- Cleaned up config file
- Added inline documentation
- Specific renderer to add layout elements
- Extracted common elements from layout pages
- Quick method to customize Bootstrap using LESS

Requirements
------------

- Moodle 2.5

Start off your theme
--------------------

### Easy download

Download the content of this repository into the `theme/` directory of Moodle. For the purpose of this walkthrough, we will assume that the directory you downloaded this theme into is `batman`.

So you should now have this directory:

    yourmoodle/theme/batman

In which there should be:

    lang/
    layout/
    pix/
    style/
    config.php
    etc...

### Easy renaming

A mandatory step is to rename all the references to `Easy`.

- Rename the file `lang/en/theme_easy.php` to `lang/en/theme_batman.php`.
- Open the file `lang/en/theme_batman.php` and write `Batman` instead of `Easy` next to `pluginname`.
- Open the file `config.php` and rename `easy` to `batman` next to `$THEME->name`.
- Open the file `renderers.php` and rename `theme_easy_core_renderer` to `theme_batman_core_renderer`.
- Open the file `version.php` and rename `theme_easy` to `theme_batman` next to `$plugin->component`.

### Easy install

Now, login as an administrator, and visit the "Notifications" page. You should be prompt to install the theme Batman. And done!

Let the theming begin
---------------------

There are 2 easy ways to style this theme, either using pure CSS, or using LESS.

### CSS

Simply edit the custom.css file, then purge your caches and voilÃ . This is extremely easy, but less flexible than it would be if you were using LESS. Customizing in pure CSS is usually recommended for minimal tweaks, or patient designers.

### LESS

The advantage of using LESS is that you do not need to override every single rule to style a large amount of places. You can easily customize Bootstrap shipped with Moodle, and all other places in Moodle re-using Bootstrap variables. To make use of this you need to be familiar with [LESS](http://lesscss.org/), and know how to compile a LESS file to CSS.

Assuming that you will be compiling the LESS file `less/mybootstrap.less` to `css/mybootstrap.css`, you will need to change the configuration of the theme to include this new CSS file. This is done by changing the value of `$THEME->sheets` in `config.php`. Simply add `mybootstrap` to get something like this:

    $THEME->sheets = array('mybootstrap', 'custom');

That's about it! Read more about this in the file `less/mybootstrap.less`.
